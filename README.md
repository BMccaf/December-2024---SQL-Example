# December-2024---SQL-Example
This is an example of an intermediate SQL query created for my employer.
We use the Credible EHR system and continously need to track performance statistics for our employees. 
The attacted SQL code queries several different databases and tables to build a final table,
that will then be used in SSRS to create a report for our end user supervisors.
